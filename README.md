# BNN
Multimodel Ensemble predictions of Precipitation using Bayesian Neural Networks

We develop a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) ensemble approach for large-scale precipitation predictions based on a set of CMIP6 climate models. BNN infers spatiotemporally varying model weights and biases through the calibration against observations. This ensemble scheme of BNN sufficiently leverages individual model skill for accurate predictions as well as provides interpretability about which models contribute more to the ensemble prediction at which locations and times to inform model development. Additionally, BNN accurately quantifies epistemic uncertainty to avoid overconfident projections.
